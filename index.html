<p>TESALIA is a tool designed to test software product lines. It has been built on top of the FaMa FW (www.isa.us.es/fama). Currently, TESALIA has three different testing operations and is able to reason over feature models attributed with android market-share data among other value and cost functions.</p>

<p>Software product lines are used to develop a set of software products that, while being dif- ferent, share a common set of features. Feature models are used as a compact representation of all the products (e.g., possible configurations) of the product line. The number of products that a feature model encodes may grow exponentially with the number of features. This increases the cost of testing the products within a product line. Some proposals deal with this problem by reducing the testing space using different techniques. However, a daunting challenge is to explore how the cost and value of test cases can be modelled and optimized in order to have lower cost testing processes. We present TESting vAriAbiLity Intensive Systems (TESALIA), an approach that uses automated analysis of feature models to optimize the testing of variability intensive systems. We model test value and cost as feature attributes and then we use a constraint satisfaction solver to prune, prioritize and package product line tests complementing prior work in the software product line testing literature.</p>

<a name="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Code</h3>

<p>You will find the sources and the required material to execute the experiments presented in the paper in this repository.</p>

<p>There are two main packages:</p>

<p>Test --> In this package you will find three classes. Each class implements one of the operations used throughout the paper.</p>
<p>Experiments --> In this package you will find the java implementation for the experiments used in the validation section.</p>
<p>To execute the classes, import the TESALIA project into eclipse or netbeans and execute the desired class. Moreover, in the Database project you can find two ms excel files with a market share database and experiment results.</p>

<p>Feel free to clone it and check it out.</p>

<p>We also provide an executable jar file that will reproduce the results shown in the SQJ paper.</p>

<p>To try it simple, download the zip file from the button below and execute java -jar tesalia.jar operationName, where operation name can be prunne, prioritize or package.</p>
